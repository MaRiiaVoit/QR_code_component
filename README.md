## My process

- HTML settings document (using standard <!DOCTYPE html>, which indicates the use of HTML5, meta tags, connecting a CSS file, setting a site icon (favicon) via <link rel="icon" ...>).
- Import fonts from Google Fonts (use "Outfit" font with different settings for import).
- CSS styling (using flexbox).
- Media queries (media queries for screens up to 375px wide and for screens with a minimum width of 1440px).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Use the basic structure of an HTML page.
- Use CSS for styling, this is applying basic styles to blocks using classes and elements, using Flexbox.
- Use media queries for responsive design.
- Use external resources - this means connecting external fonts using Google Fonts.
